Day 1.

>My first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the "GURDWARA SAGIB" located within the GNDEC campus which is mot only a spritual centre but also an architectural landmark. The atmosphere was calm and beautiful. We spent 1hr around in the Gurdwara sahib started with their blessings and it also  refletcs teh cultural heritage and values embraced by the institution. After that we had a refreshment break and then all the students from CSE and IT branch assembled in auditorium which was beautifully decorated where our Induction programe started after waiting for a while, the host invited the speaker. The lecture of sir made us feel like we already a part of GNDEC family.

>The HOD of GNDEC Harpreet Mam motiivated us to grow in life , focus on the studies as well as to take partcipate in all other activities which help's us to build our best charachter and also emphaszing its 70 year of Excellence which builds out brilliant minds.
