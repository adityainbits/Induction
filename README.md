During the leacture sir gave us basic chemistry questions and sir also explain the first chapter of the chemistry that is "Water Treatment". Sir provided valuable insights and gave us a detailed overview of internal and external marks, MSTs, Theory and lab components, and other important aspects.

>The next lecture was taken by Prof. Nisha. It was an English session focused on effective communication and how to introduce oneself in a formal setting. After explaining the key points, ma'am asked each of us to give our own introduction. When my turn came, I felt quite nervous and anxious but surprisingly, it turned out to be a good experience in the end.
